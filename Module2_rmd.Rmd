Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```


Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice


Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice


Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.


Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested


Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r pressure2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
## Insert Tables
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars), 
             caption = "Top 6 rows of cars of Dataset")
```
## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$
## Insert Images

## Insert text with some footnotes

Here is a footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks

## A slide with an inserted image
